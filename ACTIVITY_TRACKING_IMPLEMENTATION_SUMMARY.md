  petId INTEGER,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  category INTEGER NOT NULL,
  completedAt TEXT NOT NULL,

  isNew INTEGER DEFAULT 1
);

## 🎯 Feature Breakdown

### Mark as Completed Workflow

```
User taps "Complete" button
    ↓
Create CareActivity with:
  - Current timestamp
  - Scheduled time
  - Calculate on-time status
    ↓
Save to database
    ↓
Check for new achievements
    ↓
Update recurring reminder
    ↓
Show success notification
    ↓
Show achievement unlocks (if any)
```

### Statistics Calculation

**Overall Stats**:
- Total count: `COUNT(*)`
- On-time count: `SUM(CASE WHEN wasOnTime = 1)`
- Avg duration: `AVG(durationMinutes)`
- Last activity: `MAX(completedAt)`

**Day of Week**:
```sql
SELECT strftime('%w', completedAt) as day, COUNT(*) 
FROM care_activities 
GROUP BY day
```

**Hour of Day**:
```sql
SELECT strftime('%H', completedAt) as hour, COUNT(*) 
FROM care_activities 
GROUP BY hour
```

**Streaks**:
1. Get all unique dates (sorted DESC)
2. Check if most recent is today/yesterday
3. Count consecutive days
4. Track max as longest streak

### Achievement Logic

Checked after every activity completion:

| Achievement | Condition | Query |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| First Steps | `totalActivities >= 1` | Simple count |
| 7 Day Streak | `currentStreak >= 7` | Streak calculation |
| 30 Day Streak | `currentStreak >= 30` | Streak calculation |
| 100 Day Streak | `currentStreak >= 100` | Streak calculation |
| Dedicated | `totalActivities >= 100` | Simple count |
| Expert | `totalActivities >= 500` | Simple count |
| Master | `totalActivities >= 1000` | Simple count |
| Early Bird | `morningActivities >= 50` | Hour filter (5-9 AM) |
| Night Owl | `nightActivities >= 50` | Hour filter (9 PM-12 AM) |
| Perfect Week | All scheduled completed on-time | Complex query |
| Perfect Month | All scheduled completed on-time | Complex query |

## 🧮 Key Algorithms

### On-Time Calculation
```dart
bool wasOnTime = completedAt
    .difference(scheduledTime)
    .abs()
    .inMinutes <= 30;
```

### Streak Calculation
```dart
1. Get unique dates sorted DESC
2. Start from most recent
3. If today/yesterday: currentStreak = 1
4. For each date:
   - If 1 day after previous: increment
   - Else: reset to 1
5. Track max for longestStreak
```

### Time Difference Formatting
```dart
if (diff < 1min) → "On time"
if (diff < 30min) → "Xmin late/early"
if (diff < 24h) → "Xh late/early"
else → "Xd late/early"
```

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Customizable Constants
```dart
// In care_activity.dart
static const ON_TIME_THRESHOLD = 30; // minutes

// In care_activity_db_helper.dart
const EARLY_BIRD_START = 5;  // 5 AM
const EARLY_BIRD_END = 9;    // 9 AM
const NIGHT_OWL_START = 21;  // 9 PM
const NIGHT_OWL_END = 24;    // Midnight

// Achievement thresholds
const ACHIEVEMENT_EARLY_BIRD = 50;
const ACHIEVEMENT_NIGHT_OWL = 50;
const ACHIEVEMENT_DEDICATED = 100;
const ACHIEVEMENT_EXPERT = 500;
const ACHIEVEMENT_MASTER = 1000;
```
