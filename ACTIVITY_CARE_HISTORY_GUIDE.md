## 👨‍💻 Developer Guide

### Creating an Activity

```dart
final activity = CareActivity(
  id: 0, // Auto-generated
  reminderId: reminder.id,
  petId: reminder.petId,
  title: reminder.title,
  description: reminder.description,
  category: reminder.category,
  completedAt: DateTime.now(),
  scheduledTime: reminder.nextScheduled ?? DateTime.now(),
  notes: 'Optional user notes',
  durationMinutes: 30, // For walks, etc.
);

await CareActivityDBHelper.insertActivity(activity);
```

### Querying Activities

```dart
// Get all activities
final all = await CareActivityDBHelper.getAllActivities(limit: 100);

// Get today's activities
final today = await CareActivityDBHelper.getTodayActivities();

// Get by category
final feeding = await CareActivityDBHelper.getActivitiesByCategory(
  ReminderCategory.feeding,
);

// Get by date range
final activities = await CareActivityDBHelper.getActivitiesByDateRange(
  startDate,
  endDate,
);

// Get by pet
final petActivities = await CareActivityDBHelper.getActivitiesByPet(petId);
```

### Calculating Statistics

```dart
// Overall statistics
final stats = await CareActivityDBHelper.getStatistics();

// Category-specific statistics
final feedingStats = await CareActivityDBHelper.getStatistics(
  category: ReminderCategory.feeding,
  startDate: thirtyDaysAgo,
  endDate: now,
);

// Access statistics
print('Total: ${stats.totalActivities}');
print('On-time: ${stats.onTimePercentage}%');
print('Current streak: ${stats.currentStreak}');
print('Longest streak: ${stats.longestStreak}');
print('Most active day: ${stats.mostActiveDay}');
print('Most active hour: ${stats.mostActiveHour}');
```

### Checking Achievements

```dart
// Check and award all eligible achievements
final newAchievements = await CareActivityDBHelper.checkAndAwardAchievements();

// Check if user has specific achievement
final hasFirstActivity = await CareActivityDBHelper.hasAchievement(
  AchievementType.firstActivity,
);

// Get all achievements
final allAchievements = await CareActivityDBHelper.getAllAchievements();

// Get new (unseen) achievements
final newBadges = await CareActivityDBHelper.getNewAchievements();

// Mark achievement as seen
await CareActivityDBHelper.markAchievementAsSeen(achievementId);
```

### Exporting Data

```dart
// CSV Export (implemented)
Future<void> _exportAsCSV() async {
  final activities = await CareActivityDBHelper.getAllActivities();
  
  final csvBuffer = StringBuffer();
  csvBuffer.writeln('Date,Time,Title,Category,Description,Duration,On Time,Notes');
  
  for (final activity in activities) {
    csvBuffer.writeln(
      '${dateFormat.format(activity.completedAt)},'
      '${timeFormat.format(activity.completedAt)},'
      '${activity.title},'
      '${activity.category.displayName},'
      '${activity.description},'
      '${activity.durationMinutes ?? ""},'
      '${activity.wasOnTime ? "Yes" : "No"},'
      '${activity.notes ?? ""}'
    );
  }
  
  // Save to file using file_picker or path_provider
  // ...
}
```

## 📊 Statistics Calculations

### Streak Calculation

**Algorithm**:
1. Get all unique activity dates, sorted descending
2. Check if most recent date is today or yesterday
3. Count consecutive days backward
4. Track both current and longest streaks

**Code**: `_calculateStreaks()` in [`care_activity_db_helper.dart`](lib/database/care_activity_db_helper.dart)

### On-Time Detection

**Definition**: Activity completed within 30 minutes of scheduled time

**Formula**:
```dart
bool wasOnTime = completedAt.difference(scheduledTime).abs().inMinutes <= 30;
```

### Activity Patterns

**Day of Week**:
- SQL query groups activities by day
- Maps to day names (Sun-Sat)
- Identifies most active day

**Hour of Day**:
- SQL query groups by hour (0-23)
- Creates 24-hour histogram
- Identifies peak activity time

---

## 🎨 UI Components

### Activity Card
- **Header**: Category icon, title, completion time
- **Badge**: On-time indicator (green) or time difference (orange)
- **Description**: Activity details
- **Notes**: Optional user notes with blue highlight
- **Duration**: Timer icon with minutes

### Statistics Cards
- **Overall Performance**: 4 stat boxes (Total, On-Time %, Completed, Late)
- **Streaks**: 2 gradient boxes (Current, Best)
- **Category Breakdown**: Progress bars with percentages
- **Time Patterns**: Most active day and hour
- **Achievements**: Grid of emoji badges

### Filters
- **Category Chips**: Horizontal scrollable chips
- **Time Period**: Choice chips for date ranges
- **Tabs**: Today/Week/Month/All

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Customizable Settings

```dart
// On-time threshold (currently 30 minutes)
static const int ON_TIME_THRESHOLD_MINUTES = 30;

// Achievement thresholds
const EARLY_BIRD_THRESHOLD = 50; // activities before 9 AM
const NIGHT_OWL_THRESHOLD = 50;  // activities after 9 PM
const DEDICATED_THRESHOLD = 100;  // total activities
const EXPERT_THRESHOLD = 500;
const MASTER_THRESHOLD = 1000;

// Streak requirements
const STREAK_7_DAYS = 7;
const STREAK_30_DAYS = 30;
const STREAK_100_DAYS = 100;
```
